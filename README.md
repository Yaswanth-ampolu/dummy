# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio. It uses React for the frontend and NodeJS for the backend.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

This application is structured similarly to Grafana. To run it:

1.  Frontend: Navigate to the root directory and run `npm run dev:frontend`. This starts the React-based frontend using Next.js.
2.  Backend: In a separate terminal, run `npm run dev:backend`. This starts the NodeJS backend server.

The application uses Genkit for GenAI features. The Genkit server can be started with `npm run genkit:dev`.
